A key contribution to being a successful researcher in natural language processing, as in any area, is having a clear overarching vision of what your body of research is trying to accomplish. Using my own 40-year career as an example, I will attempt to provide general advice on formulating and pursuing a coherent research vision.   In particular, I will focus on formulating a unique, personal objective that exploits your specific talents, knowledge, and passions, and that is distinct from the current popular trends in the field.  I will also focus on formulating a vision that bridges existing fields of study to produce an overarching agenda that unifies previously disparate ideas.
