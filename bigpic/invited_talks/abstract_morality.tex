Disagreements and conflict are vital for driving scholarly progress, social and scientific alike. In research, we often identify gaps in others' and our own work, to present new ideas that remedy them. Disagreements are often small in nature: We disagree on methods rather than the research programme itself. In this talk, we discuss a disagreement of a different nature: namely one in which the substance of the disagreement is the existence of the task itself. We reflect on the experience of the conflict, how it was resolved, and what outcomes it has had.
